This project aims to quantify my skill level as a chess player by analyzing my game history on Lichess.org.. To achieve this, I applied my Python programming and statistical analysis skills to extract, clean, organize, and interpret data from the Lichess API.

After connecting to the Lichess API and extracting my player data in JSON format, I selected and visualized the most relevant variables to build a structured dataset. The resulting file is available at [`Datasets/user_performance.csv`](./Datasets/user_performance.csv).
