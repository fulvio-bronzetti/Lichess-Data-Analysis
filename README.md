A Python project to analyze my chess performance on Lichess.org using the official API. It extracts user statistics, visualizes preferred game modes, and downloads the last 300 rapid games in PGN format for further analysis.

The datasets used for this analysis is available in the Datasets folder. It contains metadata for my last 300 rapid games, including result, color played, opening name, and opponent rating.

Features:
 
-Secure connection to the Lichess API via personal token

-Extraction of performance metrics by game mode (bullet, blitz, rapid, etc.)

-Data visualization using bar plots

-Download of the last 300 rapid games in PGN format

-Estimation of win rates by opening and by color

Statistical test to compare win rates between playing as White and Black

Technologies Used:
-Library	Purpose
-berserk	Connects to the Lichess API
-dotenv	Manages API token securely
-pandas	Data manipulation and analysis
-matplotlib	Data visualization
-scipy.stats	Statistical testing (e.g., z-test)

Future Goals:
-Estimate the average number of blunders per game
-Visualize Glicko-2 rating progression
